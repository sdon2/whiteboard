Use Gradle to Build The Project

To start the server you use the command "java -cp whiteboard-1.0.jar server.Server [--PORT]" which allows the optional argument
PORT, specifying the port the server will be listening on.

To start the client you use the command "java -jar whiteboard-1.0.jar". There will be a popup where you can choose the
server ip and port address. These values are set to 127.0.0.1 and 4444 by default.
